You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n

        p1 = 3
        p2 = 2
        current = 0

        for i in range(3, n):
            current = p1 + p2
            p2 = p1
            p1 = current
        
        return current
